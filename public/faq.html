      <p><strong>How does the game work?</strong><br>
      A random one-minute window opens each day. During that time, a $20 prize is up for grabs — first person to submit a valid claim wins. 🤑</p>

      <p><strong>How do I win?</strong><br>
      Be ready! Once the prompt appears, enter your payout info and hit <em>“Gimme that $20”</em> before anyone else does.</p>

      <p><strong>Why do you give away $20 every day?</strong><br>
      Why not? It’s fun, random, and keeps things exciting. 😎</p>

      <p><strong>Will my information be collected and stored?</strong><br>
      Nope — we’re not paying for all that storage lol. Only the winner’s payout info is kept temporarily so the prize can be sent.</p>
